<p>You can download Facilino from <a onclick="onPageClicked('https://roboticafacil.es');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Robotica Facil</a> website or work in a browser-based version and Arduino IDE. Note while the downloaded version requires a local installation it has significant more processing power. This is highly recommended as the next instructions will follow that version and you can directly upload your code using Facilino (Arduino IDE is required to be installed so that your programms can compile and upload). If you decide to use the browser-based version, please follow the instructions refered to in the <strong>Facilino browser-based version</strong> section at the bottom of the page. Below you will find a step by step instruction for setting up the downloaded version for Microsoft Windows. For Ubuntu, please follow <a onclick="onPageClicked('http://dyor.roboticafacil.es/en/guia-de-instalacion-de-facilino-en-ubuntu/');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Ubuntu Installation Instructions</a></p>

                    <li><strong>Download Files</strong>
					<p>First, download <a onclick="onPageClicked('https://roboticafacil.es/en/download');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Facilino</a> from the <a onclick="onPageClicked('https://roboticafacil.es');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Robotica Facil</a> website.</p> 
					<p>Select your computer specific version and press the link to start downloading. Be advised that these downloads are taken from <a onclick="onPageClicked('https://github.com/roboticafacil/facilino');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Robotica Facil's GitHub</a>, where you can find the source code of the application.&nbsp;</p>
					</li> 
					<li><strong>Execute Files</strong>
					<p>Click on the downloaded file to execute it. Your computer might give a warning as the Installation comes from an unknown source. Simply, give permision under the extended tab option. The Facilino software is complety safe and does not pose a threat to your computer.</p>

					</li>
					<li><strong>Facilino Setup</strong>
					<p>The Facilino Setup should open, make sure to select the Boxes;<strong>&nbsp;Facilino</strong>, <strong>Arduino Libraries</strong> and<strong> Start Menu</strong>. If you do not have already a Arduino IDE program installed also Select <strong>Arduino IDE</strong>. Facilino is the actual application and it is required. Arduino IDE is the Arduino Software Facilino integrates in and it is highly recommended for new installations. Arduino/Facilino libraries are the additional libraries needed by some Facilino blocks. 
					The setup directly installs them in the Arduino IDE and may overwrite older Versions in your current Arduino IDE to asure compatibility. They can be changed and modified again later. Start Menu and Deskop Icon create the mentioned Start Menu and Deskop Icon for easier access from your home screen.</p>

					</li> 
					<li><strong>Facilino Installation Location</strong>
					<p>You know have to select the installation location, this is automatically set to your folder <i>C:\Facilino</i>. We recommend you not to change this path to avoid possible future administrative permissions.&nbsp;</p>
					<img src="tutorial/assets/images/Facilino_Setup_Steps/Step4.png" width="60%" alt="FacilinoStep4" title="">
					</li>
					<li><strong>Facilino Installation Process</strong>
					<p>After confirming, your installation should start immediately and a progress bar should be visible. This installation might take a few minutes, particularly when installing Arduino/Facilino libraries, because they will be first downloaded and then installed.</p>
					<img src="tutorial/assets/images/Facilino_Setup_Steps/Step5.png" width="60%" alt="FacilinoStep5" title="">
					</li>
					<li><strong>Facilino</strong>
					<p>Select the Facilino icon from the Desktop or the Start Menu. The Facilino should start up.&nbsp;You need only a couple more steps before you can start creating code. 
					On the Top Menu select Preferences and insert the License (if available) in the dialog window. Reasure that you have the right Arduino IDE path selected (in Windows this should point to <i>arduino_debug.exe</i> file. Close the window and click on <strong>Reload</strong>.</p>

					</li>
					<li><strong>Upload</strong>
					<p>With the top-right corner icons you can Verify and Upload your code. You can try a blank project with just the 'Setup/Loop' instruction to make sure everything is working order and no error messages are beeing displayed. If that is the case, read the <strong>Additional Help</strong> section at the bottom of the page.</p>

                    <li><strong>Code errors</strong>
					Incorrect use of a block might generate an compilation error, due to incorrect generated code. Facilino checks your code and in most of the cases this prevents for errors or generates warnings at potentially incorrect use of the instruction. Despite of that, there are situations that will still generate compilation errors because your code is incomplete or not used as expected. For instance, this code will generate an error due to missing inputs indicating the pins where the electronic is connected to.
					<img src="tutorial/assets/images/Facilino_Setup_Steps/missing_input.png" width="30%" alt="missing_input" title="">
					</li>
					<li><strong>Missing libraries</strong>
					Some blocks required external libraries to properly work. Please read the documentation on each instruction to succeed compiling your code. The Windows version of Facilino installs required libraries, so this issue should not appear. However, other versions of Facilino do not cover this feature, so it is your task to install required libraries in Arduino IDE.
					</li>	
					<li><strong>Arduino Compiler</strong>
					Facilino uses Arduino compiler to successfully verify and compile your code. The path to the compiler must be properly set in the Preferences of Facilino. In Windows this should point to <i>arduino_debug.exe</i> file. In Ubuntu, the path for the compiler is usually installed in <i>/usr/bin/arduino</i>, while in macOS should point to <i>Arduino.App</i>.
					</li>
					<li><strong>License</strong>
					This is one of the most common issues if you don't know how Facilino works. First, Facilino is a freemium program, which means that many of its features are for free. Advanced instructions will require a license, a 13-digit digital key that you can get at <a onclick="onPageClicked('https://roboticafacil.es/en/cat/software-en/');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Robotica Facil</a> website. Without the license, some blocks won't generate the corresponding Arduino code, which will likely generate compilation errors or simply not working as expected. There are two types of licenses: individual and server. The individual license expires after one year of use, it is intended to be used of personal use and after one year. The server license, will allow you to use the license in multiple machines and it does not expire. Please, refer to the license conditions in <a onclick="onPageClicked('https://roboticafacil.es/en/facilino-license/');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Facilino license</a>.
					<p>You can set your license in the Preferences of the application. At start-up the application will check the validity of your license. Sometimes this process doesn't work. If that's the case, check your firewall settings (there must be a rule allowing traffic Facilino app). In most of the cases, the issue arises due to slow internet connections. You can use the Reload button at the toolbar to re-validate your license.</p>
