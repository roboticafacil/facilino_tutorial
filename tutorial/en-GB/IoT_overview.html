It is an autonomous machine network that can perform almost everything, from simple to complex tasks. Its applications include healthcare, home automation, transportation and regulation systems, energycontrol and much more. The term <i>Internet of Things</i> was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, who is known as the Father of IoT. He believed that RFID would be essential to connect individual things.

			<p>IoT devices are smart devices, that is, an embedded electronic device that can be connected to other devies through Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, GSM, etcâ€¦  to transfer data to other machines, in some cases, even with several kilometers of distance.</p>
<p>An IoT device can log/collect data, communicate with other devices (M2M), analyze/visualize data and remotely act/control. All these tasks are usually part of the activity of an IoT device, although in many simple cases, an IoT device might only one or two of these tasks. A common feature in IoT devices is their low-power consumption.</p>

<p>The amount of IoT devices is growing exponentially over time. Indeed, the number of connceted things exceeded our world population in 2008. Thus, the relevance of knowing how to interact with these devices is very important nowadays.</p>

<p>If we look into the market share of different types of IoT applications, we cleary see that Smart cities, industrial applications, healthcare and Smart phones take the biggest part of this share. Intelligent cars, wearables and Smart appliances are expected to grow.</p>

<p>IoT devices typically use Wireless networks to transmit data. Depending on the application the distance between the transmitter and the receiver can be significantly different and they can make use of wire infrastructure too. In a IoT network we can find a WAN (wide area network), which transmits data at large ranges using Ethernet or a cellular network, or for medium ranges we use a WLAN (a local network). For short ranges and generally oriented for application between two machines, we can use a WPAN (a personal network).</p>
