            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>Facilino</strong> is a block programming tool based on Blockly which can be used to program Arduino and ESP microcontrollers. It can be used to program IoT devices and for many other purposes, like robots. Blockly is a tool develped by Google with a very broad purpose which has been designed to make it easy to learn programming using blocks. Facilino gives the amazing possibility to <strong>intuitive and visually</strong> generate code for Arduino and ESP microcontrollers. It has alot of examples and predetermined blocks that help you get your projects working as soon as possible!&nbsp; If you have not already installed Facilino, please follow the instruction in the <a onclick="onHomeFile('installation.html');" style="color:#1ec6c6">Installation & Setup Section</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Block programming tools provide several advantages over traditional text programming tools. While sacrificing a little bit of flexibility with the code, you gain an enourmous potential in effectivness, compilation-errors reduction and structure. Compatible blocks are usually indicated by color and shape. The intuitive nature of blocks lets your start immediately!</p>
			<p>So, first thing you should know with block programming is that everything is oriented to make things easier, but obviously you need to know how to use each of the blocks before using it. Blocks are like puzzle pieces that must fit into each other to complete the code at the correct connector. Most of instructions have a previous and next connector. These connectors will allow you to stack one block after another to execute them in a sequential manner (blocks are executed from top to bottom and until one block has been executed, the next block won't execute). To connect two blocks, both of them must have this type of connectors.

			<div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Some blocks have inputs and one (or none) output. There are three types of inputs: statement, external and online. Statement inputs accept any instruction that has a previous connection. For example, we use this type of statement inputs in some of the shown instructions, so that you can drag new instructions inside the instruction. This allows executing more instructions if some conditions are met.
			Some instructions accept external and/or online inputs. Both behave exactly the same behaviour, only the appearance changes. To these inputs we can connect the output of other instructions.
			Depending on the instruction, the type of input it accepts may be, for example, a number or a text. If you try to fit an instruction to an incorrect input, you may not be allowed, because you do not expect that type of input. This will help you to have fewer programming errors.

For example, you will find instructions that have a dropdown list that allows you to select from several options. Other instructions have a field in which we can write a number or a text, which you must provide. Sometimes, the blocks check that the number or text you enter is correct to avoid programming errors. For example, some words can not be used because they are part of the set of words that are "reserved".</p>

They are easy to recognize, thanks to all of them using the symbol of a star. If you click on that symbol you will see a small window with more instructions. The ones on the left are stackable, while the instruction on the right is a container. By dragging the instructions on the left inside to the container, you will modify the appearance of the original instruction. This is used, for example when when we want to evaluate several cases of conditional type. That is, 'If this happens, then I do this, if not I do this other thing...'</p>
